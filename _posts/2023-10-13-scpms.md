Need help with seting this up? Below we have a guide for you!

How to setup the PM Pack:

1. Download the pack
2. Unzip the archive. You should be left with a folder named models and a txt file, if you don't have these then you messed up.
3. Locate your Sven Coop directory manually or browse local files via Steam
4. Copy the models folder over to either svencoop_downloads or svencoop_addons
5. Join one of the Noobs&Nerds Sven Coop Servers, at this point it should be setup so test to see if custom player models are enabled.
