**NOTE: This article is a work in progress.**

**Please share this article with anyone you know that might be affected by the push towards TPM2.0**

**Q: What is Linux?**

A: "Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel" ~ Wikipedia.
Linux can be just about whatever the user wants it to be.
Want it to be used for a Laptop or Desktop PC? It's more then capable for that.
Want to use it as an OS for your Server? It's what most servers run these days.
Want to build something with a SBC or something similar? Linux has got you covered.

**Q: Why should I use Linux?**

A: It's free, adopts a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) culture, and once Windows 10's EOL is reached there will either be a shift towards Linux or a massive e-waste crisis will emerge… or maybe both. Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 which a lot of still perfectly functional PCs do not have. If you have one of these still functioning PCs and don't want it to end up apart of the mass amounts of e-waste then you need to learn how to use Linux now before using Windows 10 becomes a security risk.

# Choose a Distro

First you need to prep a USB storage device with Ventoy to make things simple and so you can try another distro or reinstall windows if needed.
Ventoy is extremly easy to setup on Windows, just make sure you are choosing your USB storage device so you don't mess up something else.
Once Ventoy is installed on your USB storage device/flash drive, download one of the recommended distros below and drop the ISO (or ISOs) directly on the USB drive. I also recommend putting a windows 10 onto the usb drive in case anything goes wrong or you need to go back to windows for whatever reason. Now everything should be setup. From here you restart your PC and boot into your USB drive then choose the distro you wanted then you will be brought into the installer.

**Linux Mint**

Linux Mint was the distro that made me realize that Linux is a viable alternative to Windows.
It is user friendly, comes with plenty of documentation, easy to find community support, and
can be used entirely without ever touching a Terminal or CLI (Command Line Interface) application. (But you likely will touch the terminal as you learn more)
If you are less tech savvy but still want to get into Linux then this is the perfect one to start with.

**Debian**

[https://www.debian.org/](https://www.debian.org/)

Debian is what we like to call a base distro which means it is what some other distros use as a base to build upon.
Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu and Ubuntu is based on Debian.
What does this mean for the average user?
It means that if you install this distro you get a very basic and non bloated Linux experience at the cost of it not being easy to understand for new Linux users.
You get the choice between multiple different desktop environments so you can customize it to your heart’s content. If you find that you dislike how Windows
and more beginner friendly distros try to hold your hands through everything and want to learn how to use a terminal then this is the one for you.
If you dislike the concept of bleeding edge and much prefer your things stable then this one is very much for you. If you decide to use this then MAKE SURE TO NOT ADD ANY ROOT INFO, there is no legitimate reason to not just use sudo!

# General Linux Info
**Linux Journey**

[https://linuxjourney.com/](https://linuxjourney.com/)

This website is a great resource for learning about other popular distros if you are not satisfied with the choices above,
what things are and why they function, and learning how to use command lines.

**ProtonDB**

[https://www.protondb.com/explore](https://www.protondb.com/explore)

This website is a essential tool for figuring out Proton Compatibility + checking a Native Linux port's functionality.
Use this before buying a game on steam otherwise risk buying something you cannot play.

# Videos

Below you will find guides and videos to teach you the basics needed to use the distros recommend above.
While there are plenty of other functional distros that you should try out eventually,
Mint and Debian are the only ones we can recommend as these two are easy to use when compared to something like Arch + are better environments to adjust to Linux in.

# Linux Mint

**Is Linux Mint BETTER Than Windows?**

A video meant to help Windows users understand what Linux Mint is and that it gives a very “Windows like” experience.

# Debian

**Debian is 30 this year. Here's why it's still worth using.**

Veronica Explains (content creator) shows you why Debian is still very much worth considering while explaining that it’s not a “plug and play distro”

# What to do after a fresh install

Just like after a fresh install of Windows, you should make sure your system is updated. If you used the Debian net installer then you don't really have to worry about this right away but Linux Mint Users will need to be sure to update to make sure they have the latest security and software updates.

**Linux Mint GUI**

On the right side of the panel (taskbar for windows users) you will find a Shield icon. This Shield represent's the update software that Mint uses. If you are connected to the internet the shield should turn orange within a few minutes after loging in. This means you have updates to apply. Clicking on the Shield while orange will bring up all the updates you can apply. You can choose what you want and don't want unlike Windows. By default everything will be selected, don't touch anything unless you know what you are doing. Just install the updates.

**Apt Package Manager**

On Linux Mint and Debian you can open a terminal window and enter the following commands to update your system.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
If you just tried to copy and paste these with ctrl-v and got confused don't worry because that does not work in terminals, try ctrl-shift-v. It will ask you for your password because using sudo tells the system you will be preforming an action with root permissions. Press Y and enter when given the prompt to confirm. Congrats you should now be up to date.

# Installing Software

Now depending on who you ask you will hear that this can either be a herculean task or as simple as it is on Windows. The people telling you that it is hard are likely using something like Gentoo but you as a spoiled Linux Mint or Debian user will likely have it easy. Key word there is "likely".

**Using a Software Manager/Store Front**

If you download software in .deb form off a website then all you have to do to install it is locate the file, right click on it, and open the file with "Software"

Please remember that while it's harder to get Windows Viruses and Malware on Linux, Linux Viruses and Malware still exist and can get anyone not being careful and not practicing internet safety.

**Using Apt Package Manager**

Find the package you want to install on the Debian repos for Debian, and the Ubuntu repos for Linux Mint. Now you just need replace 'package-name' on the command below with the package's name then press enter
```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

# Essential applications 	
[Steam:](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) Game CDN + easy access to Proton 

[Wine:](https://www.winehq.org/) Windows Compatibility Layer

[Bottles:](https://usebottles.com/) Sandboxed Proton, Soda, and Wine on non Steam games + applications 

[Flatpak:](https://flatpak.org/setup/) Universal Linux Package Manager

[Boxes:](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Boxes) VMs to mess with other linux distros in, requires flatpak


Remeber, there is no shame in messing up. Theres no shame in reinstalling the os and starting fresh. Take a moment to learn rather then get upset and you should actually have fun getting to know how to use linux! This webpage barely scratches the surface of what you can do with this little kernel, search engines are your friends for finding all different kinds of info, distros, support, and whatever else you might need.
