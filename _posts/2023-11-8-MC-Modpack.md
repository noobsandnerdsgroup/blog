To set up this mod pack you need:

Prism Launcher: [https://prismlauncher.org/](https://prismlauncher.org)

Java 17: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

Once you have those two setup you can setup the modpack by clicking on "add instance" then under the import tab copy and paste this link

```

```
>If your school or service provider blocks http connections you can connect to a VPN then download the file in your browser and point prism launcher to it in the import settings.

It should set everything asides from the login automatically.
